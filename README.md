Why is Protractor
* Write tests for Angular apps using WebDriver alone. 
  * Often this is done by inserting waits to pause execution until Angular is finished doing its work to make longer test code and unstable test run.

* Write tests for Angular apps using Protractor
  * it automatically understands when Angular’s digest cycle and blocks has finished loading to make cleaner test code and stable test run.
